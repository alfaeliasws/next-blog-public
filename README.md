# CREATING BLOG

Creating blog is one of my desire for a long time, I have once created it (using wordpress)but then I can’t get consistent in the writing. Not that I don’t like writing but I have many activities back then.

Now I have an advantage after failing my own mini businesses so I have time to create and write blogs.

At first I don’t think I want to write it, in these past few months, I’ve been dwelling to change career to tech jobs in this case is in coding and programming matter.

I self-learn (it is a different story how I self learn coding) and after having certificates from free courses, I need to get a job.

The things that comes to my mind is, I would love to create things that is net positive for me, not only in coding aspect but in my general interests in many things.

Then I realized that I like to write and I like to code and I need a job, so the best possible portfolio that I can do is coding blog and populate it with my writings.

Blog is still good if you want your creativity to be out there and published, even though you may not be able to have great exposure like if you be a youtuber. But still it is a great foundation, since you can make anything from your writings. 

And because of that dropping popularity, blogging makes you want to write anything that you think is important. Even though the public doesn’t think so but because your lack of interests in the view count and like count makes you able to just being creative.

So, here I am creating blog that I create myself with of course inspiration and helps of great programmer out there solving problems in stackoverflows and doing coding youtube channels and yeah, other blogs in programming scope helps me a lot too.

# CODING BLOG

The main reason of me coding a blog myself is that yes, I need portfolio to get a job in tech industry, but not only that, I see my projects as my own great creation where I can express myself not only in writings but in how I express myself with the display that I love to design.

I design it myself using Figma with of course inspirations in design from many resources, and with TailwindCSS I can create designs that is not heavy in syntax but still delivering the outcome that I want.

TailwindCSS config really helps me to achieve this. I love to have wide white spaces between the alphabet in the words and tailwindCSS able to do it for me. I love to have a certain shade of black that I can set in the config. 

Other than that, I love to have features and layout that I would love to have. I love to have minimalistic approach on design, that’s why I use clean and minimalist components with the help of shade. And in technical matters, I am happy that I can get more familiar with react syntax and my execution with react is incresing. And my Javascript skills also improved, because I use so many object notation to target the data that I want to display in the Notion API and I do a lot of mapping works, and conditional rendering logic especially I got more exposed with the ternary operation.

On the backend, I learned many things especially in API conenctions between apps and I can guarantee, using notion is a great choice. Not because it is easy, because I find combining getServerSideProps and Notion API is quite a heavylifting for my muscle brain so I can get stronger in problem solving qualities.

Still I need a lot of improvement to make the website having more improvement, and I happy that I use blog as my project and portfolio. That I can tweak and adding feature here and there, while happily maintain the website and write many thougths that I want to write.

# NOTION AS ONE OF THE TECH STACK

My Notion from the very beginning, even though I change my main second brain application to Obsidian, but notion is still great on its purpose that is creating projects and having many approach towards the projects itself. With notion API, the sky is the limit of what can developers do with powerful and wide spectrum that is offered by notion.

I can see Notion as database to be as good as mongoDB at least in writing blogs and storing data, even though the main boundaries is the security and the privacy of the data itself from the monitoring inside the notion.

But I can see the powerful database can be formed with this notion. The SQL command is cool though, no offense to the people that still use it, but to be able to maintain and manage your data visually in good UI can be a great advantage too.

Notion giving us the documentation too for the API, and the documentation is quite good, with all our question solved with the guide. It is good to have a database that in UI/UX perspective is friendly to the programmer.

# TO WRAP IT UP

Creating blog with coding is quite a journey and I finished it in a week and a half, not that quite good since I see some senior coder can write this simple blog in only hours. But more than that, the journey is quite good and I am happy that I can express myself well in this portfolio. Hope that I can have a job soon with this project. 

For the technical side of the blog I will make it in the future, the outline is ready but I need to have a right words for the technical side explanation, since English is not my main language. Please wait for it.

Here is the site of the blog:
